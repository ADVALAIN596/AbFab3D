<H2>Volume Sculpting Overview</H2>
The Volume Sculptor provides a powerful system for generating 3D printable objects.  The primary tool is called GridMaker and it
takes a datasource and a transformation.  These can be chained together to create complex objects.

<H3>Scripts</H3>
The executed Javascript is expected to have a main method.  Any parameters or files you provide from the webpage will be
passed into the main function as a single array called args.
<pre>
function main(args){
    var radius = args[0] * MM;
    var a = radius*1.1;
    var voxelSize = 0.1*MM;

    var dest = createGrid(-a,a,-a,a,-a,a,voxelSize);

    var maker = new GridMaker();
    maker.setSource(new Sphere(radius));
    maker.makeGrid(dest);

    return dest;
}
</pre>
<p>
This example has one argument, the radius of the Sphere.  Click here to run this example.  <a href="http://volumesculptor.com/creators/volume_sculptor/?example=sphere" target="_blank">"Simple Sphere</a>
</p>
<p>
A few key points.  You need to allocate the voxel Grid.  This is done with the <b>createGrid</b> function.  It takes a grid physical
size in meters and a voxelSize.  The smaller the voxel size the more accurate the grid at the tradeoff of more processing time.  A voxel
size of 0.1mm is usually sufficient.
</p>
<p>The next object we use is the GridMaker.  The GridMaker takes a data source and transformation set and evaluates those
to voxels.  In this example we place the result of the evaluation into the Grid called dest.</p>
<p>The final requirement of a script is that it returns a Grid.  This grid will be the result of the script and is visualized
by the webpage.</p>

<H2>Examples</H2>
<h3>Boolean Operations</h3>
<p>
In this example we'll show a powerful modeling technique creating objects by using boolean algebra.  Many objects can be described
by adding and subtracting primitive shapes from them.  In this example we create a cool doodad by subtracting a 3D cross from
a sphere.  Try the example here: <a href="http://volumesculptor.com/creators/volume_sculptor/?example=subtraction" target="_blank">Boolean Example</a>
</p>
<pre>
function cross3D(size, thickeness){
  var union = new Union();
  var boxX = new Box(0,0,0,size,thickeness, thickeness);
  var boxY = new Box(0,0,0,thickeness, size, thickeness);
  var boxZ = new Box(0,0,0,thickeness, thickeness,size);
  union.add(boxX);
  union.add(boxY);
  union.add(boxZ);
  return union;
}

function main(args) {
  var size = args[0];
  var thickness = args[1];
  var grid = createGrid(-16*MM,16*MM,-16*MM,16*MM,-16*MM,16*MM,0.1*MM);
  var diff = new Subtraction(new Sphere(15*MM), cross3D(size, thickness));
  var maker = new GridMaker();
  maker.setSource(diff);
  maker.makeGrid(grid);
  return grid;
}
</pre>
<p>
This script takes two parameters, the size of the cross and its thickness.  The 3D cross is created by unioning together
3 boxes.  The boxes are aligned in the x,y and z planes.  The source for the grid is the Subtraction of a Sphere and the
result of the cross3D function.
</p>
<h3>Image Popping</h3>
<p>
One of the nice features of using Voxel grids is the ability to use 2D raster image data.  In this example we'll take
an image and turn it into a 3D object.  Here we use an ImageBitMap source and give it a physical size.  We'll place
this object on both sides to create a mirror image.
</p>
<p>
Notice we changed the voxelSize in this example from the typical .1mm default.  When dealing with greyscale images you'll
likely want higher resolution to get smooth transitions between heights.
</p>
<p>
    TODO:  Describe base thickness and bluring.
</p>
Run the example here: <a href="http://volumesculptor.com/creators/volume_sculptor/?example=image" target="_blank">Image Popper</a>
<pre>
var voxelSize = 0.05*MM;

function makePart(path, width, height, thickness){
  var img = new ImageBitmap(path, width, height, thickness);
  img.setBaseThickness(0.0);
  img.setVoxelSize(voxelSize);
  img.setBlurWidth(2*voxelSize);
  img.setImagePlace(ImageBitmap.IMAGE_PLACE_BOTH);
  return img;
}

function main(args) {
  var image = args[0];
  var x = 10*MM;
  var y = 22*MM;
  var z = 3*MM;
  dest = createGrid(-x,x,-y,y,-z,z,voxelSize);
  var th = 2*MM;
  var width = 12*MM;
  var height = 40*MM;
  var img = makePart(image, width, height, th);
  var maker = new GridMaker();
  maker.setSource(img);
  maker.makeGrid(dest);
  return dest;
}
</pre>
<H3>Web Example</H3>
<p>
The web example has several panels.  The top Inspiration panel changes the example shown.  When you click on an image
the Editor panel will show the new source, the Parameters and Files panels will revert to the example defaults and the
3D view will show the result of evaluating the script.
</p>
<p>
If a script's main function references arguments then you'll need to provide values in the Parameters or Files section.  Click
the Blue Plus buttons to add a value.  TODO:  Maybe name things in examples as radiusParam and imageFile to make it obvious?
</p>
<p>
You can save a model to your local storage with the Save model button.  Currently this generates an X3D binary file.  You can
view these files with <a href="http://www.instantreality.org/">Instant Reality</a>, <a href="http://www.bitmanagement.com/products/interactive-3d-clients/bs-contact">BS Contact</a> or </a><a href="http://www.netfabb.com/basic.php">NetFabb Studio Basic</a>
</p>
<p>
The upload button will upload the model to Shapeways.  You'll be provided with a link to order the model.  Please be aware these
are public models so anyone could order them as well.
</p>
<H3>Creating your own Creators</H3>
The underlying engine for the web examples can be used in your own Javascript creator.  Once you have a script you like then we'd
encourage you to make a user-interface that's more specific and easier to use.  Once you have the parameters ready then you
can use a REST call to execute_pipeline that will generate the 3D model.  With this model you can easily use the rest of the
Shapeways API to store the models, get pricing and add your own markup to the models.

TODO:  Clean up HTML source and document the functions here.
