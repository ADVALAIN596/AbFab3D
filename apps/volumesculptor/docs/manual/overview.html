<H2>Volume Sculpting Overview</H2>
<p>
The Volume Sculptor provides a powerful system for generating 3D printable objects via simple javascript program.  
The functionality of VS is based on representaion of three dimensional objects via voxels on 3 dimensional regular grid. 
</p>
<p>
Roughly speaking the value of each voxel represents  the percent of this voxel volume occupied by the shape. 
More precisely speaking the voxel value is appropriately normalized limited range signed distance function - 
distance from voxel center to the shape surface. 
That value is represented internally by default with 8 bit precision which is equivalent to 256 different levels. 
This more precise representation greatly enchances the quality of generated objects in comparision with more traditional binary values of 0 and 1. 
The gain in quality is similar to those of grayscale image over black and white image of the same resolution. 
</p>
<p>
The voxel based representation gives Volume Sculptor greater flexibility in shapes generation over traditional representation via triangle meshes. 
It is similar to advantages 2D raster graphics has over 2D vector graphics. Vector graphics is great for drawing diagrams and raster 
graphics is on practice the tool of choice for anything else. 
</p>
<p>
The way to fill the voxel grid is to create an object with <span class="code">DataSource</span> interface, 
which can calculate signed distance function for each point in space.  This object is fed to an instance of <span class="code">GridMaker</span> 
which controls the calculations. 
The distance function calculations may be very complex task for complex object. But this calculation can be simplified by 
composing complex object from many simpler one using several simple operations. 
</p>
<p>
There are several predefines simple object like <span class="code">Sphere</span>,<span class="code">Box</span>, <span class="code">Cylinder</span>.
More complex methods include functionality to convert 2D image to a 3D embossed object using <span class="code">ImageBitmap</span> object and 
importing user provided 3D object using <span class="code">load()</span> function. 
</p>
<p>
The real power of volume sculpting is in the flexibility of combining and transforming objects represented as distance function.  
There are usual boolean operations on objects which include <span class="code">Union</span>, <span class="code">Intersection</span>, 
<span class="code">Subtraction</span>, <span class="code">Complement</span>. 
</p>
<p>
There is flexible set of transformations whci can be applied to any <span class="code">DataSource</span> object. Tranformations include standard 
3D liear transformations like <span class="code">Rotation</span>, <span class="code">Translation</span>, <span class="code">Scale</span>, 
<span class="code">Reflection</span>. Flexibility of using volume based data allows to use arbitrary non linear transformation among those are 
<span class="code">RingWrap</span>, <span class="code">SphereInversion</span>, <span class="code">FrizeSymmetry</span>,
<span class="code">WalPaperSymmetry</span>, <span class="code">ReflectionSymmetry</span>. Several 
simple transformations can be composed into more comlex transformation using <span class="code">CompositeTransform</span>. 
A transformation can be applied to any DataSource object via its <span class="code">setTransform()</span> method. 
</p>


<H2>Volume Sculptor Scripts</H2>
<p>
The sripting language of Volume Sculptor is javascript as implemented by Rhino scripting engine. All standard javasript functionality is 
supported. 
</p>
<p>
Below is the simplest complete VSS (Volume Sculptor Script) program. 
<pre class="code">
function main(args){  // this script will make a sphere

    var radius = 5*MM;       // radius of sphere 5 millimeters 
    var voxelSize = 0.1*MM;  // size of grid voxel 			
    var gw = radius*1.1;      // make the grid size a little larger to have some clearance 
	
    var grid = createGrid(-gw,gw,-gw,gw,-gw,gw,voxelSize); // create the grid 
	
    var maker = new GridMaker();            // instance of grid maker
    maker.setSource(new Sphere(radius));    // gives GridMaker object to work on 
    maker.makeGrid(grid);                   // GridMaker fills the grid with data 

    return grid;   // return the grid for final processing 
}
</pre>
<p>
Any vss script should have function <span class="code">main(arg)</span>. This function is executed by Volume Sculptor scripting engine. 
It is possible to pass arbitrary arguments (including uploaded files ) to the main(args), but we will explain this later. 
</p>
<p>
Unit of length in Volume Sculptor is <b>meter</b>. 
To avoid awkward numbers there are few useful conversion constants MM=0.001 for millimeters, IN=0.0254 for inches. 
</p>

<p>
The primary object of Volume Sculptor script is grid. The result of executing <span class="code">main(args)</span>should be grid filled with scene data. 
The scripting engine convert grid returned by main() into traditional triangle mesh which is send back to the browser 
and displayed in the 3D view.  
</p>
<p>
The grid is created via function: <br><span class="code">grid = createGrid(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax, voxelSize);</span>
</p>
Here the <span class="code">xmin, xmax ...</span> are the bounds of grid in the space. They define minimal and maximal coordinates where the final shape will be located. 
The last parameter <span class="code">voxelSize</span> is the size of grid voxel. It defines the resolution of volume rendering. 
Voxel size 0.1 millimeter corresponds to printing resolution of 3D printer. This paramerer greatly affect speed of all calculations and the best 
approach is to keep it larger (0.2mm or 0.3mm) during script developing and set to printer resolution only at the final stage. 
</p>
<p>
The primary tool of VSS is <span class="code">GridMaker</span>. GridMaker fills the grid voxels with values calculated by objects which 
have interface <span class="code">DataSource</span>. <span class="code">Sphere</span> is one of several prebuild objects with DataSource interface. 
User also can create new DataSource objects directly in script. 
</p>
<p>
Calling <span class="code">maker.makeGrid(grid)</span> does the actual calculations of the grid. Returning that grid from main initiates 
Volume Sculptor engine does conversion of grid data into triangle mesh which is returned to browser. 
</p>

</p>
<h2>Controlling parameter of output mesh</h2>
<p>
There are few variables which allow user to control behavior of volume sculpting engine. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="code">meshSmoothingWidth</span> Width of gaussian smoothing of the grid before conversion to traingle mesh. 
The width is given relative the grid voxel size. Default value is 0.5. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="code">meshErrorFactor</span> is maximal errod allowed during mesh decimation (reducing mesh complexity). It is given relative to voxel size. 
default value is 0.5. Smaller value greatly increase the resultng mesh complexity. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="code">meshMinPartVolume</span> allows to filter out sand size particles from the resulting mesh. All parts of volume less than 
meshMinPartVolume are discarded. This volume is specified in meters<sup>3</sup>. Default value is 1*MM3 (one cubic millimeter). 
</p>


<H2>Examples</H2>
<h3>Boolean Operations</h3>
<p>
In this example we'll show a powerful modeling technique creating objects by using boolean algebra.  Many objects can be described
by adding and subtracting primitive shapes from them.  In this example we create a cool doodad by subtracting a 3D cross from
a sphere.  Try the example here: <a href="http://volumesculptor.com/creators/volume_sculptor/?example=subtraction" target="_blank">Boolean Example</a>
</p>
<pre class="code">
function cross3D(size, thickness){
  var union = new Union();
  var boxX = new Box(0,0,0,size,thickness, thickeness);
  var boxY = new Box(0,0,0,thickeness, size, thickeness);
  var boxZ = new Box(0,0,0,thickeness, thickeness,size);
  union.add(boxX);
  union.add(boxY);
  union.add(boxZ);
  return union;
}

function main(args) {
  var size = args[0];
  var thickness = args[1];
  var grid = createGrid(-16*MM,16*MM,-16*MM,16*MM,-16*MM,16*MM,0.1*MM);
  var diff = new Subtraction(new Sphere(15*MM), cross3D(size, thickness));
  var maker = new GridMaker();
  maker.setSource(diff);
  maker.makeGrid(grid);
  return grid;
}
</pre>
<p>
This script takes two parameters, the size of the cross and its thickness.  The 3D cross is created by unioning together
3 boxes.  The boxes are aligned in the x,y and z planes.  The source for the grid is the Subtraction of a Sphere and the
result of the cross3D function.
</p>
<h3>Image Popping</h3>
<p>
One of the nice features of using Voxel grids is the ability to use 2D raster image data.  In this example we'll take
an image and turn it into a 3D object.  Here we use an ImageBitMap source and give it a physical size.  We'll place
this object on both sides to create a mirror image.
</p>
<p>
Notice we changed the voxelSize in this example from the typical .1mm default.  When dealing with greyscale images you'll
likely want higher resolution to get smooth transitions between heights.
</p>

Run the example here: <a href="http://volumesculptor.com/creators/volume_sculptor/?example=image" target="_blank">Image Popper</a>
<pre class="code">
var voxelSize = 0.05*MM;

function makePart(path, width, height, thickness){
  var img = new ImageBitmap(path, width, height, thickness);
  img.setBaseThickness(0.0);
  img.setVoxelSize(voxelSize);
  img.setBlurWidth(2*voxelSize);
  img.setImagePlace(ImageBitmap.IMAGE_PLACE_BOTH);
  return img;
}

function main(args) {
  var image = args[0];
  var x = 10*MM;
  var y = 22*MM;
  var z = 3*MM;
  dest = createGrid(-x,x,-y,y,-z,z,voxelSize);
  var th = 2*MM;
  var width = 12*MM;
  var height = 40*MM;
  var img = makePart(image, width, height, th);
  var maker = new GridMaker();
  maker.setSource(img);
  maker.makeGrid(dest);
  return dest;
}
</pre>
<p>
    The ImageBitMap may have optional solid base. In this case we set base thickness to be 0, which in effect eliminates the base. 
The base thickness is 	given as fraction of the ImageBitMap object thickness. For example, setBaseThickness(0.4) will make ImageBitMap 
base thickness equal to (0.4*thickness) and the thickness of image will be reduces to 0.6*thickness;
</p>
<p>
Another useful method of ImageBitMap is setBlurWidth(blurWidth). The blurWidth is given in physical units and should normally be of the same size as 
voxelSize. The blurring eliminates sharp edges in the image. 
</p>

<H3>Web Example</H3>
<p>
The web example has several panels.  The top Inspiration panel changes the example shown.  When you click on an image
the Editor panel will show the new source, the Parameters and Files panels will revert to the example defaults and the
3D view will show the result of evaluating the script.
</p>
<p>
If a script's main function references arguments then you'll need to provide values in the Parameters or Files section.  Click
the Blue Plus buttons to add a value.  TODO:  Maybe name things in examples as radiusParam and imageFile to make it obvious?
</p>
<p>
You can save a model to your local storage with the Save model button.  Currently this generates an X3D binary file.  You can
view these files with <a href="http://www.instantreality.org/">Instant Reality</a>, <a href="http://www.bitmanagement.com/products/interactive-3d-clients/bs-contact">BS Contact</a> or </a><a href="http://www.netfabb.com/basic.php">NetFabb Studio Basic</a>
</p>
<p>
The upload button will upload the model to Shapeways.  You'll be provided with a link to order the model.  Please be aware these
are public models so anyone could order them as well.
</p>
<H3>Creating your own Creators</H3>
The underlying engine for the web examples can be used in your own Javascript creator.  Once you have a script you like then we'd
encourage you to make a user-interface that's more specific and easier to use.  Once you have the parameters ready then you
can use a REST call to execute_pipeline that will generate the 3D model.  With this model you can easily use the rest of the
Shapeways API to store the models, get pricing and add your own markup to the models.
